            more than Playstation. When I play PC, my hands get really jumbled sometimes because my muscle memory isn’t that good, but on PlayStation, I don’t have that problem. Outside of esports, I am looking to graduate from the University of Michigan
            with a Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering and plan to go into Software Engineering in the future.
